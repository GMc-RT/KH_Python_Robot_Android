How to test a new feature (or how I learned to stop worrying and love Automation):

    Gather Intel.
        Define the scope, goals, resources, timeframe etc

    Plan the approach.
        Unit testing, api, smoke, UI etc, what should be a priority, where should you start

    Grab your tools.
        Decide on main language, frameworks, tools and third party software

    Smoke em if you got em.
        Get a basic set of high value, quick to roll out smoke tests out asap

    Charge!
        Refine your framework. Plans will change, so keep the tasks small, focusing on objectives that fit multiple areas at once

    Onward!
        Start to churn out tests, be ready to switch out to a new section if the business needs suddenly change

    We've got them on the run.
        Run your tests, keep an eye on total time spent on tests daily/monthly, watch for areas you can improve the numbers

    Once more into the breach.
        Maintain your existing test suites. Be sure that what you are testing is important, and whats important is being tested.
